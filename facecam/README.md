# 🎥 FaceCam NG – Real-Time Facial & Emotion Recognition (Angular + TypeScript)

A modern **Angular + TypeScript + Bootstrap** web application that uses **face-api.js** for real-time **facial detection, emotion, age, and gender recognition** directly from the user's webcam.  
All inference runs entirely in the browser — **no image data leaves the device**.

Built with a **Redux-style NgRx state management** architecture and deployed via **Vercel**.
